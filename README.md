# Free_Will_Calculator

Purpose of this project is to implement a website which can be used to test out a few different ideas I'm interested in.

First, I want to experiment with using Python's Flask package to deploy a webpage. This package let's you quickly and easily serve a web app.
Second, I want to explore interacting with a REST API.
Third, I want to learn about using JavaScript and AJAX to update the webpage without having to refresh.

The website accepts input from the user as a series of 0s and 1s, and tries to make predictions based on the prior strings about what the next entry will be. Based on how predictable the user is, they will be assigned a rating which evaluates their robot-ness.
